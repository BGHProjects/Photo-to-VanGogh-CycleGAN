# Photo-to-VanGogh-CycleGAN
- A CycleGAN that converts photos to images in the style of Vincent Van Gogh
- Uses TensorFlow, Keras, and PIL
- Also uses local directories with the datasets, which are not included in this repo
- Largely based on and adapted from the Keras documentation: https://keras.io/examples/generative/cyclegan/
